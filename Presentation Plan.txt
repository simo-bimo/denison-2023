What I've learnt:
	I started with nearly no physics knowledge.
	I've learnt a lot.

Frame the problem:
	We want to simulate quantum systems.
	How many Qubits do we need to simulate a small quantum system?
	What is the best way to do this?
	Ivan proposed using a SOFT method to explicitly simulate every component (avoiding the Born Oppenheimer approximation) and proved it was both faster and more accurate than simulating both parts separately.
	...
	What's a simpler example I can work on? 1D hydrogen!
	How do you avoid the singularity at x = 0? With a cutoff energy!
		How much error does this introduce?
		How difficult is it to adjust for this error?
		This is what I worked on!

My work:
	I've made many (classical) simulations!
		We start with a QHO, in 1 dimension, using a fock basis.
		Then we do one with the split operator method (also one dimension).
		We try it with a free particle (it seems about right).
		Then we run it with a coulomb potential.
		Then we run it with a coulomb potential, varying the values of v_cutoff
		Then we plot the energy (and we see that it changes over time O_O) [Can you actually get this to work?]
		We try a 3D simulation. It looks *mostly* right.
